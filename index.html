    <!-- History -->
    <section id="history">
        <p class="line">Coffee tastes better when it is <b> strong! <br> Do you agree?</b></p>
        <p class="border">A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee is generally safe within usual
            levels of intake and is more likely to improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of
            coffee daily. Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having bone fractures, and a possible
            increased risk in pregnant women of fetal loss or decreased birth weight. Results were complicated by poor
            study quality, and differences in age, gender,<br> health status, and serving size.</p>

        <h2>TYPES</h2>
        <p class="para">Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee cherries grow on coffee
            trees from a genus of plants called Coffea. There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants, ranging
            from shrubs to trees.</p><br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Type of bean.</b> There are two main types of coffee species, Arabica and Robusta. Arabica originates
                from Ethiopia and produces a mild, flavorful tasting coffee. It is the most popular type worldwide.
                However, it is expensive to grow because the Arabica plant is sensitive to the environment, requiring
                shade, humidity, and steady temperatures between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit. The Robusta coffee plant is
                more economical to grow because it is resistant to disease and survives in a wider range of temperatures
                between 65 - 97 degrees Fahrenheit. It can also withstand harsh climate changes such as variations in
                rainfall and strong sunlight.
            </li>
            <li><b>Type of roast.</b> Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted at a high heat to produce a
                chemical change that releases the rich aroma and flavor associate with coffee. They are then cooled and
                ground for brewing. Roasting levels range from light to medium to dark. The lighter the roast, lighter
                the color and roasted flavor and the higher its acidity and a bitter roasted flavor. The popular french
                roast is medium-dark</li><br>
            <li><b>Type of grind.</b> A medium grind is the most common and used for automatic drip coffee makers. A
                fine grind is used for deeper flavors like espresso, releases the oils, and a coarse grind is used in
                coffee presses.</li><br>
            <li><b>Decaffeinated coffee.</b> This is an option for those who experience unpleasant side effects from
                caffeine. The two rnost cormon mnethods used to remove apply beans, caffeine regulations, which from at
